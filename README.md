# Visualizations
Finding a Job for International Students can be really stressful and time consuming. I have used simple visualization techniques to track the number of jobs that I have applied to and also to keep track of the companies that I have applied to. The Visualizations are fairly basic but they do showcase foundational concepts for Visualization of data using the plotly library in Python. With time, I also plan to make the graphs more intercative using drop down menus and buttons which would make the interface more interactive and keep the user engaged.
